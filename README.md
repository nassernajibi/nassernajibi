## Hi there!

I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://abe.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Florida</a>. Please check out my <a href="https://nassernajibi.github.io/lab" target="_blank">Climate Resilience Lab</a>.

Before joining UF, I was a Research Associate in the <a href="https://cals.cornell.edu/biological-environmental-engineering" target="_blank">Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>. Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Cornell University and an ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow sponsored by the USACE Engineer Research and Development Center.

I received my Ph.D. and M.Phil. degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the Department of Civil Engineering of <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/engineering" target="_blank">Grove School of Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">The City College of New York</a> of <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">The City University of New York</a> (New York, NY) in 2019 and 2017, respectively.

I work on enhancing climate risk assessments and infrastructure resilience in built and environmental systems. I employ a combination of knowledge in physical processes, statistical models, computational statistics, and data-driven learning tools to advance our understanding of complex hydroclimate processes in a changing environment.

I am passionate about <a href="https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/" target="_blank">open science</a> and facilitating adapting <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR</a> practices in conducting and publishing research studies.

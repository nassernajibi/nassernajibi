## Hi, I'm Nasser!

I'm a postdoctoral associate in the [Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering](https://cals.cornell.edu/biological-environmental-engineering) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/).
I work towards advancing our understanding of water systems by integrating physical processes and statistical computations for analyzing and modeling complex hydroclimate processes in a changing environment.

Prior to this, I received my Ph.D. and M.Phil. degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the Department of Civil Engineering of [Grove School of Engineering](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/engineering) at [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/) of [The City University of New York](https://www.cuny.edu/) (New York, NY) in 2019 and 2017, respectively.

I employ a combination of knowledge in physical processes, statistical models, computational statistics, and data-driven learning tools to advance our understanding of water systems and hydroclimatic extremes, in particular, under changing hydroclimate and anthropogenic forcings.

I am passionate about [open science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) and facilitating adapting [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) practices in conducting and publishing research studies.
